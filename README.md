# Tic-Tac-Toe
TOP: Tic Tac Toe project

This was one of the most challenging projects so far... I started off by making the board layout, then I worked on getting two player to be able to play, then I made an "AI" (not really) that just made a random move for an "easy" vs. comp level, then I used the minmax algorithm to make a "hard" level.
